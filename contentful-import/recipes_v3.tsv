The ingredients call for a specific type of flour, WONDRA&reg; Quick Mixing Flour. This flour is milled from a blend of wheats that works for best for breading fish and poultry. Regular all-purpose flour can get cakey or clumpy on your food. WONDRA&reg; also works great for thickening lump-free sauces and gravies. We like curry powder so I've used it to help season the dish. If you aren't a fan of curry powder you can just leave it out.&nbsp; Served with polenta and green beans it makes an eye appealing meal.&nbsp; "	%3Cul%3E%3Cli%3E1+pound+%281%2F2+kg%29+boneless+skinless+chicken+breasts%2C+divided+into+4+equal+portions%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac14%3B+cup+%2850+mL%29+Wondra%26reg%3B+Quick-mixing+flour%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac12%3B+tsp+%282+mL%29+pepper%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+tbsp+%2815+mL%29+canola+oil%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+large+onion%2C+finely+chopped%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E2+large+green+peppers%2C+chopped%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+clove+garlic%2C+minced%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac14%3B+tsp+%281+mL%29+white+pepper%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1%26frac12%3B+tsp+%287+mL%29+curry+powder%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E16+oz+%28500+mL%29+tomato+puree%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+tsp+%285+mL%29+chopped+parsley%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac14%3B+tsp+%281+mL%29+ground+thyme%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Ful%3E	%3Col%3E%3Cli%3EMix+together+flour+and+pepper+in+large+plastic+bag.%26nbsp%3B%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EAdd+chicken%2C+one+piece+at+a+time%2C+shaking+to+coat.%26nbsp%3B%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EHeat+oil+in+large+saut%26eacute%3B+pan.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EOver+medium+heat+saut%26eacute%3B+chicken+until+brown+on+both+sides+and+cooked+thoroughly.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3ERemove+chicken+from+pan+and+keep+warm.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EIn+same+saut%26eacute%3B+pan%2C+stir+fry+onions%2C+green+pepper+and+garlic+for+approximately+5+minutes%2C+until+onion+is+golden+brown.%26nbsp%3B%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EAdd+white+pepper%2C+curry+powder%2C+tomato+puree%2C+chopped+parsley%2C+thyme+and+chicken.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3ESimmer+chicken+in+tomato+gravy+for+approximately+10+minutes%2C+until+chicken+is+done.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EDivide+into+4+portions.%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Fol%3E%3Cp%3ENutrition+Note%3A+1+3.5oz+chicken+breast+and+1%2F2+cup+tomato+gravy+with+vegetables+over+the+top+is+one+serving.%3C%2Fp%3E		290	50	6	1	0	65	530	31	7	12	31	1	0

The fragrant kernels grow even longer when they are cooked and are less sticky than regular rice. You can find white or brown basmati rice at your market. The brown rice is a whole grain and will have more fiber than white rice. We also like the flavor of the brown rice better. Remember if you have had weight loss surgery, cook&nbsp; 1 cup (250 mL) of rice with 3 cups (750 mL) of water or broth to help cook out all the starch.

Just add some fresh fruit and you're good to go."	%3Cp%3E%26nbsp%3B%3C%2Fp%3E%3Cul%3E%3Cli%3E2%26nbsp%3B+large+eggs%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac14%3B+tsp+%281+mL%29+pepper%2C+to+taste%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E2+small+whole+wheat+pitas%2C+warmed%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac12%3B+cup+%28125+mL%29+nonfat+refried+beans%2C+warmed%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac14%3B+cup+%2850+mL%29+cooked+diced+potatoes%2C+warmed%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac12%3B+cup+%28125+mL%29+shredded+iceberg+lettuce%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+large+sprig+cilantro%2C+chopped+or+sprig%2C+for+garnish%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26nbsp%3B2+tbsp+%2830+mL%29+salsa%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Ful%3E	%3Cp%3E%26nbsp%3B%3C%2Fp%3E%3Col%3E%3Cli%3EScramble+eggs+with+pepper.%26nbsp%3B%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3ECook+over+medium+heat+until+thoroughly+cooked.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EFill+warmed+pita+halves+with+warmed+refried+beans.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3ETop+with+warmed+potatoes+and+shredded+lettuce.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EAdd+scrambled+eggs%2C+salsa+and+garnish+with+cilantro.%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Fol%3E		220	45	5	2	0	180	620	30	5	2	13	1	0

Americans have made so many versions of goulash it's difficult to find the traditional dish. Authentic goulash is made with meat, paprika, and tomatoes and it usually has potatoes or pasta in it. The beef in this recipe is prepared by braising, meaning that the meat is browned, or seared, in hot fat and then cooked in liquid. This cooking method breaks down the connective tissue in the meat making it tender. That tenderness is important if you have had weight loss surgery because a piece of stuck beef is not pleasant! This recipe is a great for your Dutch oven."	%3Cul%3E%3Cli%3E%26nbsp%3B2+medium+onions%2C+peeled+and+chopped%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26nbsp%3B2+large+cloves+garlic%2C+crushed%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26nbsp%3B2+tbsp+%2830+mL%29+canola+oil%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26nbsp%3B2+tbsp+%2830+mL%29+paprika%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26nbsp%3B2%26nbsp%3B+pounds+%281+kg%29+lean+beef+chuck%2C+cut+into+1%2F2%22+cubes%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26nbsp%3B2+large+tomatoes%2C+peeled+and+chopped%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26nbsp%3B2+tsp+%2810+mL%29+caraway+seeds%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26nbsp%3B1%26frac12%3B+tsp+%287+mL%29+dried+marjoram%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26nbsp%3B1+tsp+%285+mL%29+lemon+zest%2C+minced%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26nbsp%3B+8+cups+%282+L%29+water%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26nbsp%3B+%26frac12%3B+tsp+%282+mL%29+pepper%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26nbsp%3B+3+medium+potatoes%2C+peeled+and+cubed%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Ful%3E	%3Col%3E%3Cli%3ESaut%26eacute%3B+onions+and+garlic+in+heated+oil+in+a+large+saut%26eacute%3B+pan+until+tender.%26nbsp%3B%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EStir+in+paprika%3B+cook+1+minute.%26nbsp%3B%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EBrown+beef+cubes%2C+several+at+a+time%2C+on+all+sides.%26nbsp%3B%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EAdd+tomatoes%2C+caraway+seeds%2C+marjoram%2C+lemon+zest%2C+water%2C+and+pepper.%26nbsp%3B%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EBring+to+a+boil.+Lower+heat+and+cook+slowly%2C+covered%2C+45+minutes.%26nbsp%3B%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EAdd+potatoes+and+continue+to+cook+about+20+minutes+longer%2C+until+potatoes+are+tender.%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Fol%3E		260	80	9	2	0	50	95	19	3	3	27	1	0

Besides eaten fresh, they are processed into canned, bottled, and jarred products.If you are a tomato lover, nothing beats the taste of a homegrown tomato. That's because they are ripened on the vine. Most tomatoes at the market are picked before they are ripe and ripened with gas while being shipped. This type of ripening doesn't develop the flavor of the tomato like the natural ripening process.Store your tomatoes at room temperature, not in the refrigerator.

We've put our surf and turf on to a skewer to make it a kabob. Kabobs originated in the Middle East and are now found worldwide and they are a favorite food for the outdoor grill. If you are using wooden skewers, soak them in water for at least 30 minutes before you thread on the food to prevent the skewers from burning. Also keep a close eye on the kabobs as they are grilling so they don't overcook and get dried out.These kabobs taste great served with horseradish sauce and our Indian Tomato and Fruit Salad."	%3Cul%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E24+medium+shrimp%2C+peeled+and+deveined+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E4+oz+%28114+g%29+beef+tenderloin%2C+cut+into+12+1-inch+cubes+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E1+tsp+%285+mL%29+granulated+garlic+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E1+tsp+%285+mL%29%3C%2Ffont%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E+ginger+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E%26frac12%3B+tsp+%282+mL%29+salt+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E%26frac12%3B+tsp+%282+mL%29%3C%2Ffont%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E+black+pepper+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E%26frac12%3B+tsp+%282+mL%29%3C%2Ffont%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E+onion+powder+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E%26frac12%3B+tsp+%282+mL%29%3C%2Ffont%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E+chili+powder+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E%26frac12%3B+tsp+%282+mL%29%3C%2Ffont%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E+dried+thyme+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E1+tbsp+%2815+mL%29+olive+oil+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E12+wooden+skewers%2C+4+inch+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Ful%3E	%3Col%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3EIn+a+large+mixing+bowl+combine+all+food+ingredients%3B+mix+well.+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3ELet+marinate+30+minutes+to+overnight.+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3EPlace+2+shrimp+and+two+beef+cubes+onto+each+skewer.+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3EPlace+skewers+over+medium+coals+on+grill%2C+for+7+minutes+or+until+shrimp+is+fully+cooked.+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3EServe.+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Fol%3E%3Cp%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3ENOTES%3A+You+can+also+bake+at+350%3C%2Ffont%3E%26deg%3B%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3EF+%28180%3C%2Ffont%3E%26deg%3BC%29%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E+or+saute+over+medium-high+heat.+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fp%3E		60	30	4	1	0	40	340	1	0	0	7	1	0

I recommend a&nbsp; roasting rack that is a nonstick, adjustable V-shaped rack so you can move the wires to fit the roast or poultry you are cooking.

Remember to add the basil at the end.&nbsp; If you add the basil too soon it will turn brown and bitter.	%3Cul%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E1+tbsp+%2815+mL%29+olive+oil+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E2+tbsp+%2830+mL%29+minced+garlic+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E1+tsp+chopped+fresh+thyme+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E2+large+plum+tomatoes%2C+chopped+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E%26frac12%3B+cup+%28125+mL%29+chopped+broccoli+florets+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E%26frac12%3B+cup+%28125+mL%29+baby+carrots+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E%26frac14%3B+cup+%2850+mL%29+chopped+asparagas+tips+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E%26frac14%3B+cup+%2850+mL%29+white+wine+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E4+oz+%28115+g%29+dry+whole+wheat+rotini%2C+cooked+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E%26frac12%3B+tsp+%282+mL%29+salt+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E%26frac12%3B+tsp+%282+mL%29+pepper+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3E%26frac12%3B+cup+%28125+mL%29+chopped+fresh+basil+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Ful%3E	%3Col%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3EHeat+oil+in+a+large+saut%26eacute%3B+pan+high+heat.+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3EWhen+the+olive+oil+is+hot%2C+add+garlic+and+thyme+and+saut%26eacute%3B+for+20+seconds.+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3EAdd+all+vegetables%3B+saut%26eacute%3B+for+5+minutes.+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3EAdd+white+wine+to+deglaze+the+pan.+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3EAdd+cooked+pasta%2C+salt%2C+pepper%2C+and+basil%3B+saut%26eacute%3B+for+5+minutes.+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%223%22%3EServe.+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Fol%3E		170	40	5	0	0	0	310	26	4	3	5	1	0

This freezes well and it can be cut into single servings and placed into airtight plastic freezer bags. When ready to reheat, simply open the corner of the re-sealable plastic bag and microwave for 2 to 3 minutes or until heated through."	%3Cul%3E%3Cli%3E6+oz+%28170+g%29+fresh+turkey+sausage%2C+sliced%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E3+cups+%28750+mL%29+shredded+unpeeled+zucchini%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E2+green+onions%2C+chopped%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+tbsp+%2815+mL%29+minced+fresh+basil%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+tsp+%285+mL%29+Italian+seasoning%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+cup+%28250+mL%29+egg+substitute%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26%238531%3B+cup+%2875+mL%29+fat+free+milk%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E2+oz+%2855+g%29+light+cream+cheese%2C+diced+into+%26frac12%3B%22+cubes%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac12%3B+cup+%28125+mL%29+shredded+sharp+cheddar+cheese%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Ful%3E	%3Col%3E%3Cli%3EPreheat+oven+to+325%26ordm%3BF+%28160%26deg%3BC%29.%26nbsp%3B%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EBrown+sausage+and+drain+well%2C+then+spread+over+bottom+of+greased+8+inch+pie+pan+or+quiche+pan.+%26nbsp%3B%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3ENext%2C+layer+zucchini+over+sausage%3B+sprinkle+scallions+and+seasonings+over+top.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EWhisk+egg+substitute+with+milk+and+pour+over+zucchini+and+sausage.+%26nbsp%3B%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3ESprinkle+with+cream+cheese+cubes+and+top+with+cheddar+cheese.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EBake+for+45+minutes+until+top+is+lightly+golden+or+knife+inserted+in+center+comes+out+clean.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3ECut+into+6+equal+pieces.%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Fol%3E		150	80	9	4	0	35	360	4	1	3	14	1	0

Always buy your fish from a reputable market. Avoid fish that has any dry or brown spots. The only smell it should have is fresh ocean smell or no smell at all. It is best to purchase it the day you plan to prepare it. We marinate the tuna to keep it from drying out on the grill. If you cook it past medium rare it will be dry."	%3Cul%3E%3Cli%3E1+pound+%28%26frac12%3B+kg%29+fresh+tuna+cut+into+4+oz+%28115+g%29+steaks%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac14%3B+cup+%2850+mL%29+low+sodium+teriyaki+sauce%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac14%3B+cup+%2850+mL%29+canola+oil%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+tsp+%285+mL%29+sesame+oil%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac14%3B+cup+%2850+mL%29+fresh+lemon+juice%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+tsp+%285+mL%29+ground+ginger%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac14%3B+tsp+%281+mL%29+red+pepper+flakes%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Ful%3E	%3Col%3E%3Cli%3EPlace+tuna+into+a+gallon+sized+resealable+plastic+bag.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EAdd+all+ingredients+and+seal+bag+and+let+tuna+marinate+for+30+minutes+to+2+hours.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EPlace+on+grill+over+medium+coals%2Fheat+and+grill+until+middle+of+tuna+is+light+pink.%26nbsp%3B+Approximate+cook+time+6+minutes%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Fol%3E		190	80	9	1	0	55	180	1	0	0	25	1	0

The shape of the pasta lends itself to certain sauces and farfalle works well with chunkier sauces, like our Tuscan Shrimp. Be sure to use fresh herbs in this recipe because of the short cooking time. Dried herbs won't have enough time to cook to bring out the flavor. For a change of pace, you can substitute the shrimp with fresh scallops or chicken.

By the way, it's OK to make this for lunch or dinner too."	%3Cul%3E%3Cli%3E2+tsp+%2810+mL%29+canola+oil%2C+divided%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E3+large+egg+whites%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac12%3B+cup+%28125+mL%29+canned+chicken%2C+drained%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E2+tsp+%2810+mL%29+slivered+fresh+ginger%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+green+onion%2C+thinly+sliced%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac12%3B+cup+%28125+mL%29+snow+peas%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac12%3B+cup+%28125+mL%29+baby+corn%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac12%3B+cup+%28125+mL%29+cooked+soba+noodles%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+medium+tomato%2C+sliced%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+tbsp+%2815+mL%29+low+sodium+soy+sauce%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+tbsp+%2815+mL%29+minced+cilantro%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Ful%3E	%3Col%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%221%22%3EAdd+1+tsp+%285+mL%29+oil+to+saut%26eacute%3B+pan+over+medium+heat.+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%221%22%3EAdd+eggs+cooking+liking+an+omelet...+Remove+from+heat+and+slice+into+strips.+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%221%22%3EAdd+remaining1+tsp+%285+mL%29+oil+to+saut%26eacute%3B+pan%3C%2Ffont%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%221%22%3E%3B+add+chicken%2C+ginger%2C+green+onions%2C+baby+corn%2C+and+snow+peas.+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%221%22%3ECook+over+medium+heat+until+ginger+is+fragrant+and+snow+peas+turn+bright+green%2C+about+1+minute%2C+and+then+add+noodles.%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B+Saut%26eacute%3B%2C+stirring+constantly+until+warm.+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%221%22%3EAdd+egg+strips%2C+tomatoes+and+soy+sauce.+Stir+over+heat+until+hot.+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%3Cfont+size%3D%221%22%3EBefore+serving%2C+sprinkle+each+serving+with+chopped+cilantro.+%3C%2Ffont%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Fol%3E		260	80	9	2	0	25	450	22	3	5	23	1	0

We know Brussels sprout haters who will eat them prepared like this. Although they look like baby cabbages and are part of the cabbage family, they are their own vegetable. Like other cruciferous vegetables, they contain high levels of cancer-preventing phytonutrients. Be careful not to overcook them as they will lose nutritional value and become bitter tasting.

We've added plenty of vegetables to our soup to go with the ground beef. We've also added barley to make it even more hearty. Most of the barley at the supermarket is pearl barley which has been processed to make it cook more quickly. You may be able to find whole grain barley in the bulk food section or at natural food stores. Whole grain barley takes at least an hour to cook so it will work in the recipe. You can also make this with ground turkey in place of the ground beef.	%3Cul%3E%3Cli%3E1+%26frac12%3B+pounds+%28%26frac34%3B+kg%29+lean+ground+beef%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+medium+onion%2C+minced%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E4+medium+carrots%2C+minced%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E3+celery+stalks%2C+thinly+sliced%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac12%3B+cup+%28125+mL%29+barley%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EOne+28+oz+%28793+g%29+can+no+salt+added+diced+tomatoes%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E2+cups+%28500+mL%29+water%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EThree+10+oz+%28750+mL%29+cans+low+sodium+beef+broth%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EOne+10.75+oz+%28304+mL%29+can+condensed+tomato+soup%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+bay+leaf%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+tbsp+%2815+mL%29+parsley%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+tsp+%285+mL%29+minced+garlic%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac12%3B+tsp+%28+2+mL%29+dried+thyme%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3Eground+black+pepper%2C+to+taste%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Ful%3E	%3Col%3E%3Cli%3EHeat+a+large+soup+pot+over+medium-high+heat%2C+and+crumble+in+the+ground+beef.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3ECook+and+stir+until+the+beef+is+evenly+browned+and+no+longer+pink.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EDrain%2C+and+discard+any+excess+fat.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EStir+in+the+onion%2C+carrots%2C+celery%2C+and+barley.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EPour+in+diced+tomatoes%2C+water%2C+broth%2C+and+tomato+soup.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3ESeason+with+bay+leaf%2C+parsley%2C+garlic%2C+thyme%2C+and+pepper.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EBring+to+a+boil.+Reduce+heat%2C+and+cover%3B+simmer+for+2+hours%2C+stirring+frequently.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3ERemove+bay+leaf+before+serving.%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Fol%3E		250	100	11	4	0	45	240	20	3	7	17	1	0

We've substituted the cream with evaporated skim milk. This canned nonfat milk is regular nonfat milk with about 60% of the water removed. This makes a thicker liquid that gives the soup the creamy texture without the calories. It still contains all the protein and calcium as regular nonfat milk. Evaporated milk can be used for drinking, just add the water back into it."	%3Cul%3E%3Cli%3E1+tbsp+%2815+mL%29+butter%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E2+onions%2C+chopped%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E2+potatoes+%2812+oz%29%2C+peeled+and+coarsely+chopped%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E2+cups+%28500+mL%29+vegetable+broth%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B%26nbsp%3B+%26nbsp%3B+%26nbsp%3B+%26nbsp%3B+%26nbsp%3B+%26nbsp%3B+%26nbsp%3B%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+tsp+%285+mL%29+%3Ca%3Epepper%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E3+cups+%28750+mL%29+chopped+broccoli%2C+fresh+or+frozen%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EOne+12+FO+%28370+mL%29+can+evaporated+skim+milk%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Ful%3E	%3Col%3E%3Cli%3EIn+large+saucepan%2C+melt+butter+over+medium+heat%3B+cook+onions+and+potatoes%2C+stirring+often%2C+until+onions+are+softened%2C+about+10+minutes.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EAdd+broth+and+pepper%3B+bring+to+boil.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EReduce+heat+to+medium%3B+cover+and+simmer+until+potatoes+are+tender%2C+about+15+minutes.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EAdd+broccoli%3B+cover+and+cook+for+5+minutes.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EIn+food+processor+or+blender%2C+puree+soup+until+smooth.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EReturn+to+pan%3B+stir+in+evaporated+milk+and+heat+through.%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Fol%3E		210	30	4	2	0	10	410	37	5	14	10	1	0

What kid doesn't like noodles and cheese? They didn't even know they were eating cottage cheese. The kids are grown and gone and I am still making this dish. Spinach noodles taste pretty much like regular egg noodles so don't expect a strong spinach taste. I have made this with regular egg noodles but the green noodles look more appealing. This is one of my go-to recipes because I usually have all the ingredients on hand.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vicki	%3Cul%3E%3Cli%3E6+oz+%28170+g%29+dry+spinach+fettuccini%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+cup+%28250+mL%29+sliced+onion%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac14%3B+cup+%2850+mL%29+chopped+green+pepper%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+tbsp+%2815+mL%29+butter%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+cup+%28250+mL%29+low+fat+cottage+cheese%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac12%3B+cup+%28125+mL%29+light+sour+cream%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+tbsp+%2815+mL%29+Worcestershire+sauce%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac14%3B+tsp+%281+mL%29+salt%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac14%3B+tsp+%281+mL%29+pepper%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac14%3B+tsp+%281+mL%29+garlic+powder%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+cup+%28250+mL%29+reduced+fat+shredded+cheddar+cheese%2C+divided%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Ful%3E	%3Col%3E%3Cli%3EPreheat+oven+to+350%26deg%3BF+%28180%26deg%3BC%29.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3ECook+fettuccini+according+to+package+directions.+Drain+and+set+aside.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EIn+a+medium+pan%2C+melt+butter%3B+saut%26eacute%3B+onion+and+green+pepper+until+tender.+Remove+from+heat.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EMix+fettuccini+with+cottage+cheese%2C+sour+cream%2C+salt%2C+pepper%2C+garlic+powder%2C+and+3%2F4+cup+%28175+mL%29+shredded+cheddar+cheese.+Stir+in+onions+and+green+pepper.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EPut+mixture+into+1-1%2F2+qt.+%281-1%2F2+L%29+casserole+dish.+Sprinkle+with+remaining+1%2F4+cup+%2850+mL%29+cheddar+cheese.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3ECover+and+bake+for+25+minutes.+Remove+cover+and+bake+for+an+additional+15+minutes%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Fol%3E		220	55	6	4	0	20	400	26	2	5	15	1	0

You'll find it in the fresh produce department. It has a large, white bulb on the bottom with long celery-like green stalks that have feathery leaves. The bulb is the edible part of the vegetable and has a licorice or anise taste.

The spice blend can be quite hot but we've toned it down for Western tastes. Instead of using a commercially blended curry powder, our recipe features a blend of traditional east Indian spices. One of the spices that is almost always found in a vindaloo is tamarind. It is a long pod fruit that is found in various forms in the market. You will want to use the ground powder for this recipe. If you are new to Indian cuisine and aren't sure about the heat of the recipe, use a bit less of the tamarind, cumin, mustard, tumeric, and cayenne pepper. Vindaloos are traditionally served over rice.

It took almost 90 minutes to cook&nbsp; but it was well worth the wait.&nbsp; I wanted a little more vinegar after it was prepared but that may not be your taste preference.&nbsp; So a little more or less vinegar depends on your tastes. 	%3Cul%3E%3Cli%3E3+chicken+boneless%2C+skinless+chicken+breasts%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E3+chicken+boneless%2C+skinless+chicken+thighs%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+clove+garlic%2C+crushed%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac14%3B+cup+%2850+mL%29+chopped+onions%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26frac14%3B+cup+%2850+mL%29+distilled+vinegar%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E2+cups+%28500+mL%29+low+sodium+chicken+broth%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+bay+leaf%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+cup+%28250+mL%29+no+salt+added+tomato+sauce%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E8+peppercorns%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1+medium+red+bell+pepper%2C+chopped%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E3+cups+%28750+mL%29+peeled%2C+cubed+potatoes%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Ful%3E	%3Col%3E%3Cli%3E%26nbsp%3BIn+a+medium+sauce+pan+add+chicken%2C+garlic%2C+onions%2C+vinegar%2C+chicken+broth%2C+bay+leaf%2C+tomato+sauce%2C+and+peppercorns.%26nbsp%3B+Bring+to+a+light+simmer%3B+cover+and+simmer+for+20+minutes.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26nbsp%3BUncover+chicken%3B+stir.+Add+potatoes+and+red+pepper.%26nbsp%3B+Cover%3B+cook+an+additional+20+minutes+or+until+chicken+is+done.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E%26nbsp%3BRemove+bay+leaf+and+serve.%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Fol%3E		210	36	4	1	0	70	135	21	3	4	23	1	0

This dish tastes great and is easy to make so don't be fooled by the prep time for this recipe. Although it may seem like a lot of eggplant when you cut it up, it cooks down by almost half. I didn't peel the eggplant and the skin helped it hold up during the last cook time. If you have had weight loss surgery, you may want to peel it to reduce the chances of the peel getting stuck. If you peel the eggplant, reduce the cook time so the eggplant cubes hold their shape.

The eggs are separated (www.chefdave.org/blog/entry/chef_dave_tips_how_to_separate_an_egg1). Let the egg whites come to room temperature, about 30 minutes, before separating so when you beat them, you will get more volume. The original recipe made a large tube pan but I cut it in half and put it in a small tube pan.As I found out from making this, sponge cake can be tricky so be sure to have everything at hand, measured, and ready to go before you start beating the eggs. In chef's terms this is called mise en place. Be sure to fold ingredients by hand where indicated. If you use your mixer your cake will end up too dense.The great thing about this cake is that if you are going to eat cake, this is one of the lowest calorie cakes you can make. It is low in fat since the only fat comes from the egg yolks. No oil or butter is added. This cake is not sweet and the mango topping makes it just right. If you don't like mangos, you can top it with most any kind of fruit or fruit puree.

You can cook with it because it won't separate when it is heated like traditional plain yogurt. That's because Greek yogurt is strained to separate and remove the whey.&nbsp; This process makes Greek yogurt thicker and great for cooking. We like to cook with curry because it is a blend of flavorful Indian spices that have been shown to have health benefits. The curry&nbsp; flavor is mild in this recipe so you can add more&nbsp; to suit your taste.	%3Cul%3E%3Cli%3E1%26frac12%3B+cups+%28375+mL%29+nonfat+Greek+yogurt%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E3+tbsp+%2845+mL%29+Dijon+mustard%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E2+cloves+minced+garlic%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3E1%26frac12%3B+tsp+%287+mL%29+curry+powder%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3ESalt+and+pepper%2C+to+taste%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EFour%26nbsp%3B+4oz+%28115+g%29+boneless+skinless+chicken+breasts%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Ful%3E	%3Col%3E%3Cli%3EMix+together+the+yogurt%2C+mustard%2C+garlic%2C+curry%2C+salt%2C+and+pepper.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3ESpread+the+mixture+on+the+chicken%2C+making+sure+to+rub+the+yogurt+mixture+in.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EPlace+in+a+baking+dish%2C+cover%2C+and+let+marinate+for+at+least+2+hours.%3C%2Fli%3E%3Cli%3EPreheat+oven+to+375%26deg%3BF+%28190%26deg%3BC%29+.+Bake+the+chicken+with+the+yogurt+marinade%2C+uncovered%2C+for%26nbsp%3B+30+to+35min+or+until+chicken+reaches+165%26deg%3BF+%2875%26deg%3BC%29%26nbsp%3B+internal+temperature.%3C%2Fli%3E%3C%2Fol%3E		190	27	3	1	0	75	430	7	0	3	0	1	0
